					      <div class="panel-body">
					      	<p>1. GOD HEAD. We believe in One God, eternally existent in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.
					      	</p>
							<p>2. DEITY OF CHRIST. We believe in the Deity of Christ; that in Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. We believe that Christ was conceived of the Holy Ghost, was born of a virgin, died by the means of the cross, rose again from the dead and ascended into Heaven
							</p>
							<p>3. BIBLE. We believe that the Bible is the inspired and infallible word of God. We believe that the gospel of Christ is the power of God unto salvation to us who believe.
							</p>
							<p>4. RAPTURE. We believe in the rapture of the church and the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ We believe that following the tribulation, Jesus shall return to earth the second time as king of kings and Lord of Lords, and together with His saints, who shall reign a thousand years as kings and priests.
							</p>
							<p>5. MAN AND HIS FALL. We believe that man is a created being, made in the likeness and image of God, but through Adam's transgression and fall, sin came into the world.
							</p>
							<p>6. SALVATION AND ETERNAL [ZOE] LIFE. We believe that salvation is the gift of God to man, separate from works and the Law. That salvation is totally free by grace alone through faith in Jesus Christ. We believe that Salvation is an experience of reality [New Birth] in which eternal life as a free gift of God is bestowed upon man freely. We believe in the new birth, eternal life [zoe] is possessed by the believer as a present or Now reality rather than a future promise.
							</p>
							<p>7. SANCTIFICATION. We believe in the sanctifying power and work of the Holy Ghost. That sanctification is a definite, work of grace consummated in the Christian by the Power of the Holy Spirit.
							</p>
							<p>8. HOLY GHOST BAPTISM. We believe in the baptism in the Holy Ghost is the gift of God to all believers and is subsequent to the new birth. This experience is accompanied by the initial evidence of speaking in other tongues as the Holy Ghost gives utterance.
							</p>
							<p>9. MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT. We believe in the manifestation of the Holy Ghost, upholding all diversities of gifts, differences of administrations and t he diversities of operations. We uphold that all manifestation of the Spirit is given to profit withal and all be ministered in love.
							</p>
							<p>10. WATER BAPTISM. Baptism in water by immersion is a direct commandment of our Lord and is for believers only. This ordinance is the Christians' identification with Christ in the death, burial and resurrection.
							</p>
							<p>11. MIRACLES, SIGNS AND WONDERS. We believe in miracles, signs and wonders as a confirmation of His gospel which we preach but also as a display of God's love and compassion to His people.
							</p>
							<p>12. DIVINE HEALTH. We believe that through the sacrifice of Christ divine health has become every believers' birth right, that all should prosper and be in health. It is God's will (God is both able and willing) to heal all, of all manner of Sickness and disease.
							</p>
							<p>13. SIN AND FORGIVENESS OF SIN. We believe that only through Christ is the forgiveness of sins and through His precious blood is eternal cleansing of sins through faith in Him.
							</p>
							<p>14. HELL. We believe that one who physically dies in his sins without accepting Christ is hopelessly and eternally lost in the lake of fire and therefore has no further opportunity of hearing the gospel of repentance. The term "eternal" and "everlasting" used in describing the duration of the punishment of the damned in the lake of fire, carry the same thought and meaning of endless existence as used in denoting the duration of Joy and ecstasy of saints in the presence of God.
							</p>
							<p>15. HEAVEN. Heaven is a real place referred to as heaven of heavens where God is and not just an atmosphere or celestial heavens. We believe that when a believer ceases physical existence on earth [dies] then heaven is his eternal home.
							</p>
							<p>16. NEW COVENANT. We believe we have a new and better covenant through the blood of Christ Jesus; where Christ [Himself] is
